# 🛒 Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

This project presents an interactive **Sales Analysis Dashboard for Blinkit**, developed using Power BI. It was collaboratively created by **me and my friend** to explore key business metrics, improve our analytical skills, and apply real-world data visualization techniques.

Blinkit (formerly Grofers) is a fast-growing instant delivery platform. This dashboard visualizes Blinkit's sales performance across various dimensions like revenue, product categories, regions, order quantities, and customer segments.
